# MAGA - Spring 2025

Welcome to **MAGA**!

MAGA is a startup that, once it grows in popularity, will no longer reference
**Microsoft**, **Apple**, **Google**, **Amazon** but in fact this unicorn company. (The investors are sure of this.) You were hired to work on the system administration team, and the recruiter was particularly impressed by your knowledge of Linux. 

Your job is to help some front-end developers getting the company website up to date.
